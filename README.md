# DJITelloPy_E205
Final project for Harvey Mudd College Spring 2020 E205 Systems Simulation course.  Developed by Max Maleno '20 and Kevin Shoyer '20.

Repository is originally forked from damiafuentes' DJITelloPy due to its robustness and strong foundations for communicating with the Tello using Python 3.  It's a great project!

Signicant Changes log:

2020-04-07 -- datalogging (both Tello telemetry and videostream) is implemented.  CSV file and AVI video is generated for every session.
DJI Tello drone python interface using the official and [Tello EDU SDK](https://dl-cdn.ryzerobotics.com/downloads/Tello/Tello%20SDK%202.0%20User%20Guide.pdf). Yes, this library has been tested with the drone. 

## Walkthrough/tutorial
A nice writeup will be written in the near future...

- T: Takeoff

- Arrow keys: Forward, backward, left and right.
- A and D: Counter clockwise and clockwise rotations
